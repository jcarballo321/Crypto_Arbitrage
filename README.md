# Crypto_Arbitrage

## Overview

In this project, I'll take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of my department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

For this project, Iâ€™ll sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. My task is to apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.
